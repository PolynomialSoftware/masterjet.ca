        Master Jet Pressure Washing Ltd. applies a hospital grade food safe sterilizing chemical designed for stainless
        and plastic. We then hot pressure wash the carts to get to all the nooks and crannies that wiping can not
        achieve. Pricing is based on quantity and the cleaning is done at your location. Call us now for an onsite
        quotation.
